/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css,
 * which will include all the files listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets,
 * or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced
 * here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear
 * at the bottom of the compiled file so the styles you add here take
 * precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS files in this directory.
 * Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *
 * Bootstrap uses Less CSS but rails asset pipeline supports scss.
 * Used bootstrap-sass converts Less to Sass. so we used SCSS to take Bootstrap
 *
 * require_tree ensures all CSS files in the app/assets/stylesheets directory
 * (including the tree subdirectories) are included into the application CSS
 *= require_tree .
 *= require_self
